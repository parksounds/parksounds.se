# thrown till Park Sounds 2022

Brand new Swedish quartet thrown, fronted by ex-GrievedÂ vocalist Marcus Lundqvist, drop their misanthropic debut single 'grayout', streaming now via Arising Empire. 

Presenting lyrics filled with anger and self-hatred, the 4-piece effectively blends intense and crushing guitars with catchy yet aggressive vocal rythms. Without warning thrown aims to become prominent with their modern take on heavy music.

With 'grayout' being the first step on making a new impression on the scene including the works of producer Buster Odeholm (who is also the drummer of the band) and music video director Lucas Englund (Parkway Drive, Architects) thrown brings their A to the game from day one and we're all here for it.

Vocalist Marcus Lundqvist is joined by Johan Liljeblad and Andreas Malm on guitars, and drummer Buster Odeholm (Vildhjarta/Humanity's Last Breath) as thrown aim to spread their message of self-loathing through their mix of gut-punching metalcore and anger-inciting hardcore.

With ambition already pushing the band to seek out touring opportunities throughout 2022, it'll be no time before thrown have you singing a long and bursting all your energy in the pit at a live show.

"...extended pain."
